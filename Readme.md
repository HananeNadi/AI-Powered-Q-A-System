# Chat with Your PDF using Gemini 

## Overview
This Python application allows you to upload a PDF and ask questions about its content using natural language. The system employs a Language Learning Model (LLM) to generate responses based on the document, ensuring that answers remain relevant and accurate.

## Features

- Ask natural language questions about the document.

- Receive AI-generated responses specific to the document content.

- Ensures responses remain relevant to the uploaded document.

## How It Works

1. Upload a PDF file.

2. The application extracts text from the document.

3. The text is processed and stored in a vector database.

4. You can ask questions related to the document.

5. The LLM generates responses based on the document content.


## Technologies Used

- Streamlit for the web interface.

- PyPDF2 for extracting text from PDFs.

- LangChain for managing conversational AI.

- FAISS for vector-based document retrieval.

- Google Gemini AI for generating responses.

- dotenv for managing environment variables.
